the cortical masks and anterior corpus callosum masks are generated by freesurfer_volume_select.m
normalizeT1oT2.m does the normalization of T1/T2 maps for myelin mapping.
gradientfromlesion.m is used to generate the raw gradient output graphs (without normalizing to percentage radial distance or volume)
Later part of gradientfromlesion.m can generate masks for dilation and erosion of lesion ROI.
gradientlesion_contralateral.m generates percentage radial distance-normalized output for the lesion gradiates.
It also make the final figure that compares the trends/gradients across different subtypes.
